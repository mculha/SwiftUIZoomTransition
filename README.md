## SwiftUI Zoom Transition

###  New in iOS 18
SwiftUI provides a zoom transition effect that can be used when pushing to a new view with a NavigationStack, and also used when pushing to a sheet or a full-screen cover presentation. It's works similarly to a matched geometry effect, except it works across presentations where matched geometry effect fails.
